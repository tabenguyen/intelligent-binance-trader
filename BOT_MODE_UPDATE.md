# 🎯 Bot Mode Update Complete - Scheduler-Optimized

## ✅ What Changed

### **Before**: Internal 1-Hour Loop

- Bot ran continuously with internal `time.sleep(3600)`
- Wasted resources waiting between scans
- Difficult to coordinate with optimal 4H candle timing

### **After**: Single Execution + External Scheduling

- **Default Mode**: Run once and exit cleanly
- **Legacy Mode**: `--continuous` flag preserves old behavior
- Perfect for cron jobs and external schedulers

## 🚀 New Bot Behavior

### Single Execution Mode (Default)

```bash
uv run python main.py
```

- Executes one complete trading cycle
- Exits cleanly when finished
- Perfect for scheduled execution
- **Logs**: "🏁 Single execution completed - exiting for scheduler control"

### Continuous Mode (Legacy)

```bash
uv run python main.py --continuous
```

- Maintains old behavior with internal loop
- Only for special use cases or manual testing

## 📋 Updated Commands

### Bot Execution

```bash
# Normal scheduled execution
uv run python main.py

# Legacy continuous mode
uv run python main.py --continuous

# Version info
uv run python main.py --version

# Help
uv run python main.py --help
```

### Scheduling (No Changes)

```bash
# Setup cron (recommended)
./setup_cron.sh

# Test scheduler
./run_scheduled.sh --test

# Python scheduler
nohup python3 scheduler.py > logs/scheduler.log 2>&1 &
```

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Resource Efficiency**: No idle time between scans
2. **Precise Timing**: Perfect alignment with 4H candle closes
3. **Better Logging**: Clear start/stop boundaries
4. **Scheduler Control**: External scheduler handles timing
5. **Quality Focus**: Each execution is deliberate and targeted

## 🏁 Ready for Production

The bot now runs optimally for the **Quality over Quantity** strategy:

- **Scheduled**: 6 times per day at perfect 4H candle timing
- **Efficient**: No wasted resources or idle time
- **Reliable**: Clean exits and comprehensive error handling
- **Flexible**: Supports both scheduled and continuous modes

Your trading bot is now perfectly optimized for external scheduling! 🎯
