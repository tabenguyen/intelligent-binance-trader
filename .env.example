# ADVANCED QUALITY FILTERS - High-Quality Signal Selection
# =============================================================================

# Multi-Timeframe Trend Filter
# Only takes long positions if price is above daily 50-EMA
# Prevents counter-trend trades - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
ENABLE_DAILY_TREND_FILTER=True

# ATR Volatility Filter  
# Avoids choppy markets (too low volatility) and chaotic markets (too high volatility)
# Ensures optimal trading conditions - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
ENABLE_ATR_FILTER=True

# Volume Confirmation Filter
# Requires strong volume backing for signals
# Confirms genuine buying pressure - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED  
ENABLE_VOLUME_FILTER=True

# Minimum volume ratio (current volume vs 20-period average)
# 1.2 = 20% above average volume required
MIN_VOLUME_RATIO=1.2

# =============================================================================
# Filter Configuration Notes:
# =============================================================================
# 
# For MAXIMUM quality (recommended):
# - Enable all three filters (True, True, True)
# - This will reduce signal frequency but increase win rate
# 
# For more frequent signals (less strict):
# - You can disable individual filters by setting to False
# - Start with all enabled and adjust based on your preference
# 
# Volume ratio settings:
# - 1.2 (20% above average) = Moderate filter
# - 1.5 (50% above average) = Strict filter  
# - 1.0 (average volume) = Loose filter

PARTIAL_TP1_PERCENTAGE=0.5        # Percentage of position to sell (50%)

# Take Profit 2: Sell remaining 50% when profit reaches 3:1 Risk:Reward ratio  
PARTIAL_TP2_RATIO=3.0             # R:R ratio to trigger second partial exit

# =============================================================================
# ADVANCED EXIT STRATEGY LOGIC:
# =============================================================================
# 
# This sophisticated exit system maximizes profits while minimizing risk:
# 
# 1. ENTRY: Position opens with initial OCO order (stop loss + take profit)
# 
# 2. FIRST PARTIAL EXIT (TP1):
#    - When profit reaches 1.5:1 Risk:Reward ratio
#    - Sell 50% of position (locks in early profit)
#    - Move stop loss to breakeven (remaining position becomes risk-free)
# 
# 3. TRAILING STOP MANAGEMENT:
#    - ATR-based trailing stop for remaining 50%
#    - Stop follows price up but never moves down
#    - Distance = Current Price - (ATR × 2.0)
# 
# 4. SECOND PARTIAL EXIT (TP2):
#    - When profit reaches 3:1 Risk:Reward ratio
#    - Sell remaining 50% (full exit with maximum profit)
# 
# BENEFITS:
# - Locks in profits early (reduces risk)
# - Allows for maximum upside capture
# - Risk-free position after TP1
# - Adapts to market volatility (ATR-based)
