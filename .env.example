# ADVANCED QUALITY FILTERS - High-Quality Signal Selection

# Multi-Timeframe Trend Filter
# Only takes long positions if price is above daily 50-EMA

# Ensures optimal trading conditions - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
ENABLE_ATR_FILTER=True

# Volume Confirmation Filter

# Confirms genuine buying pressure - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED  
ENABLE_VOLUME_FILTER=True

# Minimum volume ratio (current volume vs 20-period average)

# =============================================================================
# Filter Configuration Notes:
# =============================================================================
# 
# For MAXIMUM quality (recommended):
# - Enable all three filters (True, True, True)
# - This will reduce signal frequency but increase win rate
# 
# For more frequent signals (less strict):
# - You can disable individual filters by setting to False
# - Start with all enabled and adjust based on your preference
# 
# Volume ratio settings:
# - 1.2 (20% above average) = Moderate filter
# - 1.5 (50% above average) = Strict filter  
# - 1.0 (average volume) = Loose filter
#
